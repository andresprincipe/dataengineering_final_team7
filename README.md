### Main data source is found at https://opendata.maryland.gov/
- Under the “Environment” category on Maryland’s open data website, there are “enforcement actions” taken by the state of MD to those who violate air and safety regulations. This data gets updated daily and has an API. It contains details about the different sites (companies) and what actions were taken against them for violating air regulations. It also includes county data that can be combined with the other datasets.
